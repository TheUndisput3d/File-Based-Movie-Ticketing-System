## 🧩 Modules Overview

### `data_store.py`
Handles reading and writing JSON files for movies, showtimes, and bookings.

### `movie.py`, `showtime.py`, `booking.py`
Each model includes:
- Constructor
- `to_dict()` for serialization
- `from_dict()` for deserialization

### `admin_service.py`
- `add_movie(title, genre)`
- `add_showtime(movie_title, time, seats)`

### `user_service.py`
- `book_ticket(user_name, movie_title, time, seats)`
- `cancel_booking(booking_id)`

### `input_handler.py`
Reusable input prompts and validation for both admin and user roles.

### `main.py`
Main loop for role selection and interaction.

## Data Persistence

All data is saved and loaded using JSON files for persistent storage:

- `data/movies.json`: Stores all added movies
- `data/showtimes.json`: Maintains scheduled showtimes and available seats
- `data/bookings.json`: Contains user booking records

This eliminates the need for temporary in-memory lists, allowing the system to retain state between sessions.
